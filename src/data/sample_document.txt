Sample Document for RAG Chatbot Testing

This is a sample document that you can use to test the RAG chatbot system.

About Artificial Intelligence:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

Machine Learning:
Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

Deep Learning:
Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data. Deep learning has been particularly successful in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

Natural Language Processing:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of human languages in a manner that is valuable.

Vector Databases:
Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are particularly useful for similarity search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, where documents are embedded into vector representations for semantic search.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation:
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. It first retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base, then uses those documents as context to generate more informed and accurate responses.

This document contains various topics related to AI and machine learning that can be used to test the question-answering capabilities of the RAG chatbot system.
